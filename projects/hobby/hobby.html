                <p>Hi everyone, my name is Carlos Roldan. In my spare time as a hobby, I like to play baseball and when not playing, I enjoy watching the <a href="https://www.mlb.com/giants">San Francisco Giants </a> on television. I first began playing baseball when at the age of 9 years old a flyer of the <a href="https://jrgiantsathome.org/">San Francisco Junior Giants </a> appeared at my neighborhood Recreation Center in the Bayview. I was intrigued and asked my parents for permission to join. They agreed that it would be great for me to join and I was off to learning the basics. </p>

                <div class="row">
                    <a href="https://youtu.be/V6XTVk7FPfI?t=64"><img src="pexels-tima-miroshnichenko-5184705.jpg" alt="A baseball pitcher throwing a ball on a mound"
                            style="width: 7em; height: auto;" align="right" />
                    </a>
                    <p>First, I began by learning the fundamentals of throwing and catching a baseball. Throwing a baseball will require
                        to have a baseball and a partner. Throwing a baseball requires to learn the proper form to throw a ball as not
                        to cause injury on your arm. This video demonstrates the correct way to throw a ball. <br><a

                </div>

                <br />

                    </a>

                    <p>Secondly, how to hit a baseball with a bat is crucial in playing baseball. To learn how to hit a baseball you will need a bat and a ball. Learning will require proper swinging technique so not to injure yourself. Swinging a bat will require you to use your hips to generate power and torque to swing. Here is a good video link to watch to practice proper technique.<br> <a href="https://youtu.be/G_n_tlesB-I">Click Here</a> to learn how to swing a baseball bat.</p>
                    
                    <br />

                    <p>Hopefully after reading and watching the videos on this website you are ready to hit the field and begin playing. 
                    </p>
                    <br />
                    <p>With enough practice you may be the next Major League Baseball MVP !!! </p>
